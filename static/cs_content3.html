    Development of a Handicraft E-Commerce Platform: Empowering Artisans through Global Reach
    In an increasingly digital world, traditional Kashmiri artisans faced a significant challenge: how to reach global
    markets that were shifting online. The absence of direct access to consumers meant that artisans were often dependent on
    middlemen, who reaped the financial rewards while the creators themselves were left with minimal returns. ArtStay and De
    Koshur Crafts recognized this gap and sought to create an e-commerce platform that would revolutionize the way Kashmiri
    handicrafts are marketed and sold.
    
    The development of an exclusive e-commerce platform, supported by the Hamdan Craft Revival Foundation, provided artisans
    with a direct line to global consumers. This platform was designed to showcase the rich diversity of Kashmiri crafts,
    including Pashmina, Paper Mâché, carpets, and woodwork, all while offering a secure and transparent purchasing
    experience. The blockchain-enabled platform integrated by CraftLore allowed consumers to verify the authenticity of each
    product, ensuring they were purchasing genuine, handmade items directly from the artisans.
    
    The platform not only democratized access to international markets but also ensured fair wages for artisans by
    eliminating middlemen. Through partnerships with luxury brands and global distribution channels, the platform positioned
    Kashmiri artisans in front of a new generation of consumers who value authenticity, craftsmanship, and cultural
    heritage. This e-commerce solution not only generated sustainable income streams for artisans but also elevated the
    global profile of Kashmir’s handicrafts, ensuring that these traditional art forms thrive in the modern marketplace.
